#The Giphy App: Complete Version

I should find a more creative name. Maybe take the little ghost as the mascot.

The project's idea is to recreate one of my first websites, but with updated syntax, way better practices and a backend in node.js to add more features.

##Backend:
- I have to organize way better mainly the server's routes
- Connects the front with the database
- Authentication

##Frontend:
To make the front end the most impressive possible, I'll take some ideas from the freefrontend website and maybe from the awwwards, but I'll make them only by myself so I can improve my css skills.
IMPORTANT: check if it's reasonable do it with styled-components

- First I'll reorganiza the whole folder structure so it has a pattern that can be maintenable
- Probably I can use a useContext hook to share the gifs state globally so it wil be easier to access them on the user's saved gifs page
- For the authorization on react, maybe I can use Formik and then connect it with my controllers on the server.
