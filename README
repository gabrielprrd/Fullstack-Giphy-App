#The Giphy App: Complete Version

The project's idea is to recreate one of my first websites, but with updated syntax, better practices and a backend in node.js to add more features.

##Frontend:
To make the front end the most impressive possible, I'll take some ideas from the freefrontend website and maybe from the awwwards, but I'll make them only by myself so can improve my css skills.
IMPORTANT: check if it's reasonable do it with styled-components
Always adopt the "component first" approach
