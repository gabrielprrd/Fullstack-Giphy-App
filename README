#The Giphy App: Complete Version

I should find a more creative name. Maybe take the little ghost as the mascot.

The project's idea is to recreate one of my first websites, but with updated syntax, way better practices and a backend in node.js to add more features.

##Backend:
- Connects the front with the database
- Authentication

##Frontend:
To make the front end the most impressive possible, I'll take some ideas from the freefrontend website and maybe from the awwwards, but I'll make them only by myself so I can improve my css skills.
IMPORTANT: check if it's reasonable do it with styled-components

- I'll only start the css part when I totally finish the funtionality part. Front and backend.

Tarefas do dia:

- Alguma coisa está errada no state que vai uma query atrasada. Provavelmente o erro tá no useEffect (ler https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-it-safe-to-omit-functions-from-the-list-of-dependencies)
