#The Giphy App: Complete Version

The project's idea is to recreate one of my first websites, but with updated syntax, better practices and a backend in to add more features.

The application allows the user to register, search for gifs or stickers fetching the Giphy endpoint and save them. All that using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js) stack.
