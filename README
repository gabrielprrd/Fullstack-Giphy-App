#The Giphy App: Complete Version

I should find a more creative name. Maybe take the little ghost as the mascot.

The project's idea is to recreate one of my first websites, but with updated syntax, way better practices and a backend in node.js to add more features.

##Backend:
    ## Next steps:
        - Log out

##Frontend:
To make the front end the most impressive possible, I'll take some ideas from the freefrontend website and maybe from the awwwards, but I'll make them only by myself so can improve my css skills.
IMPORTANT: check if it's reasonable do it with styled-components

- I'll only start the css part when I totally finish the funtionality part. Front and backend.
